Documentation for the RailCore II 3d printer and its components

## About the RailCore II
RailcoreII is a Core-XY based Reprap 3d printer designed by J. Steve White & Tony Akens under the [[CC-Attribution Only license]]. The initial idea to collaborate on a printer started in the #RepRap IRC channel, and centered on some common goals we both had in mind for a new printer design.
