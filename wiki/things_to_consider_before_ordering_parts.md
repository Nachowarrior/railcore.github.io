## Things to Consider Before Ordering Parts

  * Decide on a quality of [Linear Rails](/Linear_Rails.md)
  * The aluminum parts are highly recommended
  * Consider what bed surface you wish to use, and match your Z-probe to that. (Don't use IR with a reflective surface)
  * Shop the parts around for better quality or a lower price, depending on the build you want
  * Ask questions on Facebook or in the IRC!
  * A build will take 15 - 25 hours total
