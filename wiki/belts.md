## Belts

**NOTE**: when planning to change from printed to aluminium idler and motor mounts add several cm extra length to your belts as the idler mounts will move the idlers further outside then the printed ones.
 
 To assist with belt tensioning measure belt frequency using a tool such as:-
 
 * a guitar tuner 
 * a guitar tuner app on your mobile
 * "Gates Bicycle Belt Tension Meter" app
 * [Gates Carbon Drive app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gates.carbondrivecalculator)
 
Belts have been measured to usually be around 60hz on the long return. The belt returns on the left, between the two idlers, should be around 40-45Hz or so, according to Gates' design software.

5m of belt is enough to do both belts on either printer. The 300ZL is roughly 2.2m of belt per side.
