### Side Panels

The side panels are usually milled from HDPE with a thickness of 6.35mm (6mm works as well and might be easier to source)

Other materials that have been used by builders.

* Melamine MDF
* Hardboard
* Acrylic (there are concerns it might crack around the bolts for mounting)
* Masonite Pegboard
* Plywood (hardwood such as birch)
* Aluminum

Other possible solutions

* Delrin
* Dibond
* Almost anything that's ~6mm thick and not stretchy should work.
