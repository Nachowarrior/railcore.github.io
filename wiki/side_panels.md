The side panels are usually milled from HDPE with a thickness of 6.35mm (6mm works as well and might be easier to source in some countries)

Other materials have been used:-

* Melamine MDF
* Hardboard
* Acrylic (there are concerns it might crack around the bolts for mounting)
* Masonite Pegboard
* Plywood (hardwood such as birch is preferable)
* Aluminum

Other possible solutions:-

* Delrin
* Dibond
* Almost anything that's ~6mm thick and not stretchy should work.

The Railcore II font seen on some side panels is Windows 10 "Middle Ages"
