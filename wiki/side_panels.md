### Side Panels

The side panels are usually milled from HDPE with a thickness of 6.35mm (6mm works aswell and might be easier to source)

Other materials that have be used.
* 6mm Plywood (birch is good)
* Melamine MDF
* Hardboard
* Acrylic (there are concerns it might crack around the bolts for mounting)
* Pegboard ("Masonite-ish)
* MDF
* Aluminum

Other possible solutions

* Delrin
* Dibond
* Almost anything that's ~6mm thick and not stretchy should work.
