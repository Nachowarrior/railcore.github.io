title: Tapping tips
--- 
  * Use a 1515 railcore extrusion jig to make your life simpler.
    * [Jig 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2917782)
    * [Jig 2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3369802) with F360 file
  * Fluid recommendations:
    * Millers Tapcut Fluid
    * TapMagic
	* Community recommendations include WD40 and Anchorlube G-771
  * Watch a few videos on how to tap.
  * Try for half a turn forward, quarter turn back (more proficient tappers can do more than this!)
  * Keep the tap straight.
  * When resistance builds up and gets tight, go back until it frees, then go back more. Then go forwards once again.
  * Repeat until you bottom out or hit your jig.
  * It helps to use a short tap handle if you're particularly brutish or just unsure.
  * Regularly use tapping fluid and compressed air to clean out the tapped hole.
  * Deburr with a countersink after tapping
  * Use a sharp knife to deburr the top at the end.
  * Clean off all tapping fluid at the end. Some of them are sulphur based and oily and you don't want this hanging around.
