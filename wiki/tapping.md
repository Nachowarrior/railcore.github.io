  * Try for half a turn forward, quarter turn back
  * Keep the tap straight.
  * When resistance builds up and gets tight, go back until it frees, then go back more. Then go forwards once again.
  * Repeat until you bottom out or hit your jig.
  * It helps to use a short tap handle if you're particularly brutish or just unsure.
  * Regularly use tapping fluid and compressed air to clean out the tapped hole.
  * Deburr with a countersink after tapping
  * Use a sharp knife to deburr the top at the end.
  * Clean off all tapping fluid at the end.
