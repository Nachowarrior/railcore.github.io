### Build Surfaces

There is plenty of good information out there on bed surfaces and their adhesion. This is just a summary of any surfaces when used with the Railcore.

**Lokbuild** is the build surface on the BOM. Compatible with dc42's mini-differential IR sensor and BLtouch.

**PrintBite+** - printed parts “self release” as the heat bed cools down with this surface. However be aware that it seems that it may be translucent to IR and so not a good surface when combined with dc42's mini-differential IR sensor (which is the standard on the BOM)

**BuildTak** Works well with BLTouch, folks report erratic results with IR. Stuff sometimes ticks too well when used on a fixed bed; is best suited for a removable flex bed like the magnetic bed.
