There are several options for leadscrew couplers, listed in order of preference.  This is opinion, feel free to test and evaluate yourself.

#### 1. Joint Coupler

These couplers are made of two separate pieces of aluminum and a center plastic joint. They center the leadscrew & stepper better than the solid couplers, and are very quiet. Less Z artifacts than either the rigid or spring couplers.



#### 2. Solid Coupler

These Couplers are a rigid style. Issues are mostly around centering the leadscrew and stepper shaft.  Quieter than a spring style coupler, but can add wobble and some Z artifacts.



#### 3. Spring Coupler

These Couplers are a common basic coupler. In testing they were louder than the others, and added Z-artifacts / banding.
