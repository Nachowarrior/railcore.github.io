title: Recommended priority of Aluminium Parts
---  

The recommended order replacement of the RailCore II ZL series 3D printed parts with aluminium replacements is:-
    
1. X Carriages, Idler pulley mount set & Stepper mounts - **(recommended for ZL and highly recommended for ZLT)**
1. **(ZL only)** Hotend mount 
1. Z Yokes - **ZLT highly recommended**
1. Z Brackets
1. **(ZLT only)** Hotend mount
1. Magbed
1. Halo - doesn't seem to improve prints, but does pre-align belts
1. Aluminum Y carriage - lighter than the printed part, and saves you weight

### Longest swap times after assembly

1. Magbed
1. Z brackets
1. Halo
