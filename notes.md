#### What size bolts are used for the halo?  M3x10?  Also, any tips for removing and reusing the Keenovo heater?

I used M3x10 I lift the nuts in the aluminum channel with a zip tie.
You can re-apply 3M 77 or 90 spray adhesive and re-attach.
Wade got his off and re-attached using fishing line.
I removed and re-attached a keenovo. Seemed to work, then shorted out internally and made a burning smell. looks like half of the internal circuitry died, so the front half was getting twice as hot as needed....
