10-15A SSR required.

You can get cheap chinese SSR's for $2, but it is recommended to buy genuine/certified SSR's from a known source such as RS Components or Farnell for ~$20 range.
These are AC voltages, and you **really** don't want to mess around.

Good makes are Crydom (Sensata-Crydom) and Panasonic.
