# Regular maintenance

Your Railcore will benefit from regular maintenance, which will keep it in good working order and improve the quality of your prints. We suggest:

## Weekly Schedule

 * Depending on use, clean the bed surface with a suitable cleaner for your print surface.
 * Extruder check?
 * Do a visual check of the printer, looking particularly for anything loose. Check your axes are moving freely.
 * Check belt tension as per the belts page

## Monthly schedule

 * Check and put lubricant on the Z lead screws and rails and move the Z axis through its range.
 * Check and put lubricant on X & Y rails and move these axes through their range.
 * Check for the latest full [release of Duet firmware](https://github.com/dc42/RepRapFirmware/releases) and upgrade if necessary.
 
## If you move your printer

 * Perform a visual check before switching on. Especially the electronics (moreso if your wires are not attached to the panels)
 * Run the functiontest macro to check nothing has come loose during transit.
