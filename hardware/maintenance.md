# Regular maintenance

Your Railcore will benefit from regular maintenance, which will keep it in good working order and improve the quality of your prints. We suggest:

## Weekly Schedule

 * Depending on use, clean the bed surface with a suitable cleaner for your print surface.
 * Extruder check?
 * Do a visual check of the printer, looking particularly for anything loose. Check your axes are moving freely.

## Monthly schedule

 * Wipe off any debris from the smooth rods with kitchen roll or similar, and put a drop of light oil (eg 3-in-1 oil) either side of each linear bearing. Then slide each axis back and forth to check movement is smooth and easy. Be careful not to drip oil on the bed; it will ruin part adhesion to the bed.
 * Also put a few drops of PTFE oil on the Z lead screws and move the Z axis through its range.
